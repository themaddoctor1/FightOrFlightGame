# FightOrFlightGame
Fight or Flight is a game that I wrote where the player becomes able to run progressively faster by running. The player 
must fight endless waves of enemies that become more difficult to fight over time.

##Enemies
| Type | Description | Initial Wave |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Combat Drone | A flying sphere that shoots a lot of bullets at the player. | 8 |
| Drain Drone | A flying sphere that can drain the player's ability to move quickly. | 8 |
| Fist Fighter | An enemy that fights using melee. | 1 |
| Ghost | A partially invisible gunman that is hard to see. | 11 |
| Gunman | An enemy that shoots bullets at the player. | 4 |
| Health Drain Drone | A flying sphere that can drain the player's health. | 8 |
| Runner | An enemy with the same abilities as the player. | 13 |
| Telekinetic | An enemy that can stop bullets and the player using its mind. | 13 |
